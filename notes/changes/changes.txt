to-do:
-add rain storms that water all plots
---------------delay screenshot until 1 sec past switching views
---------------add popup each time the user upgrades
---------------add popup each time the user drinks
---------------add bark interaction and SFX
-add game music
	-Add title screen with buttons (Play, Quit, Site, Credits, How-To-Play)
	-Add room checks for each of the obj_constant events
	-Change load and save timing

-Regression after adding additional Room + changes to obj_constant
-Add 'water' text to mouse over state of plants
-fix bug where plots are not occupied --> add to save/load flow

///Save Function
var _plots_string = "";
//plots are created at runtime, instead of creating them at runtime we should edit them at runtime.
var _num_plots = instance_number/instance_count(obj_plot);
for(var i =0; i < _num_plots; i++)
{
	//Create a list of non-empty plots
	var _plot_inst = instance_find(obj_plot, i);
	if _plot_inst != -1
	{
		if _plot_inst.occupied == true
		{
			_plots_string += string(x) + ",";
			_plots_string += string(y) + ",";
			_plots_string += string(occupied) + ",";
			_plots_string += string(occupied_by) + ",";
			_plots_string += string(plant_object) + ",";
			_plots_string += ":";
		}
	}
}

///Load Function
Could use some sort of reloaded variable so that certain plots are created, then when they are all (1200) created some of them will delete themselves if they
overlap with one of the saved + loaded plots

var _all_plots_str_array = string_split(map["plots_string"], ":");
for (var i = 0; i < array_length(_all_plots_str_array); i++)
{
	var _single_plot_array = string_split((_all_plots_str_array)[i], ",");
	var _x = _single_plot_array[0];
	var _y = _single_plot_array[1];
	var _occupied = _single_plot_array[2];
	var _occupied_by = _single_plot_array[3];
	var _plant_object = _single_plot_array[4];
	
//////////// if updating:
	var _plot = instance_find(obj_plot, _x, _y);
	_plot.occupied = _occupied;
	_plot.occupied_by = _occupied_by;
	_plot.occupied_by = _occupied_by;
